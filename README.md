# OpenGL-3D-Renderer

## This project is to make a simple standalone  renderer that allows importing and displaying 3D models.

Ultimately the goal is to learn more about c++, graphics programming, shaders, and engine architecture.

Currently, the 3D Math code is not connected to the OpenGL renderer so all we can render is flat shapes.
